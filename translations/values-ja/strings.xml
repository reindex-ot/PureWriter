  <string name="defaultContent">Writing connects us with the past and lets us imagine the future. However, have you ever experienced some writing software: slow to start, causing inspiration to slip away? Frequently errors lead to wasted words? Lack of many necessary features and aids for writing feels inconvenient?\nPure Writer can solve all these problems. It\'s a super-fast plain text editor, and we hope that writing can return to its original form: <b>pure, secure, anytime, without losing content, and with a good writing experience.</b>\nPeace of Mind\nThe icon of Pure Writer is a projection of a time machine, implying that words can take us through time and space, and also corresponds to the \"history record\" and \"automatic backup\" features specially provided by Pure Writer. With these protections, even if you accidentally delete the text, or your phone suddenly loses power and shuts down, your article can still be completely saved or found in the history record. Over the years, Pure Writer has provided a reassuring, secure writing experience, achieving the rare feat of no loss, and has been widely praised.\nSmooth and Fluid\nIn addition to achieving the most important security guarantee, the UI interface and various writing aids of Pure Writer can also make users feel that this application is really pleasing to the eye and smooth. Pure Writer has adapted the soft keyboard interface of Android 11, allowing your fingers to smoothly control the rise and fall of the soft keyboard. At the same time, it also provides a breathing cursor, the cursor is no longer just flashing, but like human breathing, gradually fading in and out. Many such details, Pure Writer has polished to the extreme, while it has many writing aids, such as \"automatically completing paired symbols\", deleting paired symbols when pressing delete, pressing the enter key to jump out of the quotation range when completing dialogue content... Many such aids will feel timely and natural, when you compare with other editor applications, you will find Pure Writer does it better, smoother, and more meticulous.\nSimplicity in Complexity\nMany basic features that an editor should have, Pure Writer has not missed, such as quick input bar, <b>multi-device cloud sync</b>, paragraph indentation, paragraph spacing, generating beautiful long images, undo, word count, dual editor side by side, one-click format adjustment, find and replace, Markdown, computer version... and some very creative features, such as: using the TTS voice engine to read out the text you input in real time, helping you check in a different sensory way whether the input text is correct. For example, it has achieved \"unlimited word count\", as long as your phone\'s performance allows, there is no word limit. Even so, Pure Writer still maintains a minimalist design style, follows Material Design, and is both useful and beautiful.\nYou can reach the inspiration page at super fast speed, and you can interrupt and continue writing anytime, anywhere. Pure Writer has done all this for you. A reassuring and smooth writing experience, this is Pure Writer, please enjoy writing!</string>

  <string name="presetTitle1">Pure Writer - Connecting the past and future with words</string>
  <string name="presetContent1">Pure Writer is a fast and comfortable text editing app that prevents you from losing your works. While scrolling the comments and reviews of Pure Writer in Google Play, you might find some high praises for this app like \"There\'s no app better than this\", \"The most satisfying app\", \"Love this app so much\", \"Love at first sight for this app\"… As the only developer for Pure Writer, the comments were especially gratifying for me. \nIn June 2017, after I went through countless uncomfortable, poorly done text editing products and lost my precious text files, I am determined to develop my own text editing app that allows its users to write anytime anywhere in a feature-filled and comfortable environment, knowing that their words will never disappear. This app, as I decided, will be developed with a writer\'s perspective. \nBefore all this, I was working part-time on a rich text editing software. Although we poured our hearts over it, the software did not turn out the way we wanted it to be. Despite that, I successfully developed some unique features that is more than enough for Pure Writer. \nAnd so Pure Writer is born. From the very beginning, Pure Writer took care of perfecting each line and character spacing on Android. This is the special feature that no other text editing android apps has achieved besides Microsoft Word. And yet the package size of Microsoft Word is more than ten times larger than Pure Writer\'s.\nNot only that, Pure Writer also provides special features like \"launch text editor on app start\" and especially \"History records\". As a writer myself, I understand the utmost importance of having a history record — it allows you to focus on your writing while giving you a peace of mind that you will never, ever lose what you are writing. Even if your phone shuts down suddenly without any notice, Pure Writer can still save your content automatically. This way, all users are able to start and stop writing whenever they wish in a comfortable text editor with confidence. \nIn addition to that, Pure Writer supports \"Input Shortcuts\" and \"Formatting tools\", input shortcuts allows users to set their own custom words into the shortcut bar, so that they can reuse it over and over again with ease; formatting tools help users to quickly format their text for example auto spacing and arranging. \nNot only these features, a lot of effort was put into perfecting the tiniest detail in Pure Writer. While using Pure Writer, you are able to hide the soft keyboard by simply swiping the screen, get the cursor to be exactly where you want it to be and also keep the text still while you hide the soft keyboard… If you were to compare Pure Writer to the other text editing apps, you will find that Pure Writer has perfectly taken care of all the small details that eventually contribute to a perfect writing environment.\nPure Writer has the editing tools you need for example: auto indentation, export text as various files including images, floating word count, canceling, Markdown, custom background themes, night mode, biometric encryption, text auto complete, sharing and much more. Despite all the features and details, Pure Writer still kept its minimalistic style and follows the Material Design guidelines. I also made a \"Time Machine\" for users to make small notes and keep them. The name \"Time Machine\" is taken from the comic, with the meaning of \"Connecting the Past and Future with words\". \nUntil today, Pure Writer\'s code base has received over one thousand commits and millions of lines changes. Although Pure Writer consumes almost all of my free time, it is always a relief that more and more users are giving me positive feedback. I actively connect with Pure Writer\'s users, collecting feedback and perfecting the app. I\'ve never felt happier at the thought of making something long term that helps other people. \nFinally, thank you to all my friends who helped me throughout this journey. Without you, this app would never be where it is today. With this post, I introduce you to the original ideas of Pure Writer and all of its special features, and hopefully more people would get to know it better. Let\'s hope that we are able to leave wonderful memories behind in the limited time we have. Let our Words take us back in time, and bring us to imagine the future.</string>
  <string name="presetTitle2">Pure Writer - 保護メカニズム</string>
  <string name="presetContent2">The current protective mechanism that Pure Writer has is: \n1. The text will be saved once the content is changed. If that fails, Pure Writer will notify the user immediately. \n2. Pure Writer will check if your content is saved in the database every two seconds. If it fails, Pure Writer will notify the user immediately. \n3. If it fails to autosave, then the users will not be able to exit the app completely. Pressing the exit button at this time is the same as pressing the Home button without completely stopping the app. This will allow some time for the user to manually save their content. \n4. Every time the app is running in the background or exited, it will automatically backup the whole database if any content is edited. The backup file can be accessed anytime. The backup will be save along with the previous version of the backup to allow users to revert the backup.\n5. The History record, undo and redo feature is provided to every text  \n6. Has a Trash folder to prevent accidental deletion of texts.\n7. Cloud backups: if Pure Writer is integrated with WebDAV, then it will automatically backup all the database content including the texts to the cloud.</string>
  <string name="presetContent3">If you enjoyed using Pure Writer and wish to have it actively developed, would you mind contributing a few bucks to encourage the developer?\nYour support can encourage independent developers like me to make more useful apps. \nTo contribute, you can press the \"Unlock Pro\" button in the top right corner of the Settings page. As a token of appreciation, you will be able to get Pro features like \"Save as…\" and \"Custom background/Papers\". \nPure Writer will also improve as a result of your support. Thanks in advance! If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to email me at drakeet@drakeet.com</string>
  <string name="presetTitle4">Pure Writer - プライバシーポリシー</string>
  <string name="presetContent4">Pure Writer takes its users\' privacy very seriously, it will never collect any of your private information. \nAlso, it will not read or modify any content on your clipboard without first notifying you.\nThe storage permission that Pure Writer asked for is solely used for auto backup and save your files. Other than that, it will not read or modify any of your files in the storage without first notifying you.\nPure Writer supports cloud backup, which uses HTTPS encryption to transfer your database backups to your WebDAV cloud storage. Your cloud backups will only be stored in the cloud storage you set, and they will never be uploaded to other places.</string>

In addition, as the author of Pure Writer, I prefer the original Pure Writer design, which is more eye-catching and focused on text content, so this design feature is actually developed in response to the strong demands of a small number of users. It requires a lot of extra development costs, and it is not easy to provide, and since there will be two Pure Writer design now, the work of developers may multiply.\n\nBecause of this, Pure Writer will recommend you to pay for it, but you can still have a lot of time to experience and make a final payment decision. Please try to support it. If the statistics show that the proportion of users who are willing to pay is small, the developer may cancel or stop maintaining the Material Design 2. Once you click the OK, you will be deemed to agree to this content by default.\n\nThank you all! I will do my best to provide a better and better Pure Writer, please enjoy!</string>

This sync button will automatically appear when you need to sync, and you need to click it to sync the current content with the cloud storage.\n\n‼️\nSometimes, this button fails to detect the content that needs to be synchronized at the first time. If you want to synchronize immediately, you can click the ⊕ button at the bottom of the editor, and then you can immediately see the synchronization button and trigger a synchronization immediately.</string>

  <string name="cloudSyncReadme">You are about to enable the \"Cloud Sync\" function. Before this, you need to carefully understand some precautions. This is very important. Otherwise, you may lose some texts. Please be aware of:\n\n* The cloud backup and cloud synchronization of Pure Writer are completely free functions. We urge everyone to read the following content carefully, so that even if this function is provided for free, we will feel that it is worthwhile to develop these functions. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation! If in the future we find that many people are unwilling to understand the following, <b>we may abandon the cloud sync function</b>(‼️).\n\n* If you click the \"OK\" button below, you agree to the following content, and Pure Writer will immediately perform a cloud synchronization.\n\n* Currently the cloud storage for cloud synchronization is the same as your cloud backup storage.\n\n* If you have selected \"Manual\" mode in \"Cloud Sync Mode Options\", then when there is content that needs to be synced, a sync button will appear at the bottom of the editor, you need to click this button every time to sync with cloud storage.\n\n* You need to ensure that all devices are installed with Pure Writer v20.0 or above, and are logged into the same cloud backup storage, so that these devices can synchronize content with each other, that is, if the cloud backup storage on different devices is not the same one account, then these devices cannot be synchronized with each other.\n\n* Pure Writer will automatically query the cloud storage for content that needs to be synchronized at regular intervals. If there are new changes, a synchronization button will be displayed at the bottom of the editor, and you can click the button to synchronize at an appropriate time. Normally it will be checked every 20 seconds, or 10 seconds when there is a Wi-Fi network. This network request consumes very little traffic and you don\'t need to worry about it.\n\n* Most important (‼️): Before syncing, you cannot edit the same text on two devices, otherwise the later edited content will directly overwrite the earlier content, which will cause you to lose part of the text. If you need to edit the same text on two devices, the correct way is to click the sync button to sync the content to the cloud storage after editing the text on one device, and then click the sync button on the other device after the synchronization is complete to sync content to this device, so you can edit the latest texts on this device.\n\n* If you can\'t understand what the previous prompt is saying, it is recommended that you do not enable the cloud sync function, otherwise some texts will be lost!\n\n* Pure Writer will package and backup all your original data once before each synchronization. You can click \"Restore Backup\" on the Backups page to see it.\n\n* Always remember that Pure Writer has \"History\" and \"Auto Backup\" functions.\n\n* Cloud sync does not support Markdown images.</string>

In reality, Pure Writer is not capable of automatic updating or upgrading at all, unless it has root permissions. No App can perform an automatic updated.\n\nSo why has it been updated then?\n\nBecause the <b>system app store decided to update it for you</b>.\n\nGenerally, system app stores have the auto-update function enabled by default. This is an external behavior that can\'t be resisted. If you attribute this behavior to Pure Writer and accuse us in the app store of \"forced updates\", it is really sorry. Even if we wanted to change and solve it, we can\'t because the app store is a system-level App and we, as a non-system app, have no power to escape system control.\n\nPlease understand, if you don\'t want to receive updates of Pure Writer in the future, you can go to the system app store and turn off the \"automatic update\".\n\nPlease trust that our daily continuous development and submission of new versions of Pure Writer to the app store is purely out of responsibility and goodwill, only to bring users a better user experience. If you can understand and modify your comments about \"Pure Writer\'s forced updates\", we would be greatly appreciative!</string>
